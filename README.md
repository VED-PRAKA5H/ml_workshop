# ml_workshop
This is a machine learning workshop repo.
## Part 1: EDA
* We will use the iris dataset.
* And doing the exploratory data analysis on iris dataset.

## Part 2: Face Detection with Dlib and OpenCV
* This project uses OpenCV and Dlib to perform real-time face detection and landmark identification from a webcam feed.
* The detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, and facial landmarks are marked with circles.

## Part 3: Coloring of Black & White Image
* I'll be doing an overview of image processing and recognition.
* And also be able to build one such working model for yourself from scratch.
* Learn the basics of Classification & Colorization Problems, Neural Networks, etc.
